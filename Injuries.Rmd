#4. The data frame depicts numerical data about things like Age and body mass index. They are measured in kilograms and centimeters as well as years. Gender is described as 1 for male or 2 for female. BMI is measured in (kg/m**2). There are outliers in every data set, however they should not be excluded because they're from the sample and removing them would be discrimination. Their body, their choice.
